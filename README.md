# Java-Fantasy-Football
I created a College Football fantasy football program using Java. 
This program was originally for a final project for an Object Oriented Programming class that I took in the fall of 2020. It is organized in a simple Model, View, Controller format, and contains 19 classes. The program works just like a real fantasy football league, where the user is able to draft players to form their team, adjust their lineups, and trade with other teams throughout the season. The user is put in a league 7 other players whose draft and team is simulated using random numbers from the computer. The players in the game are real college football players, and their point total is simulated every week based on how good they are in real life. The UI for this program is through the console.
